# Equation_of_motion

This project demonstrates the implementation of the basic Equations of Motion using Python. It calculates final velocity, displacement, or acceleration based on user-provided values using the following standard kinematic equations:
	•	v = u + at
	•	s = ut + ½at²
	•	v² = u² + 2as
